Lets discuss the flow:

1. on mounting app component dispatched "pageLoaded" action

2. action goes to the middleware where we the services are injected (logger and api). It triggers the logger service and then dispatches another action (loadTodos)

3. A) the same thing happens again, it goes to the middleware where the api service is injected.
   B) We dispatch a set loading action with a true argument (triggering the log service)
   C) then fetch the todos list using the api services
   D) if successful, we dispatch a (loadTodosSuccess) action with the fetched todos as an argument
   E) reducer adds the todo to the state
   F) dispatch another action to set the loading off
   G) if error, we dispatch (loadTodosFailure)

4. Onclick => 
A) we dispatch a a put todo function with an updated todo arguments ( we changed the completed )
B) clone the todo from the state and update it with the new todo
C) dispatch a setTodos action with the new todos array as an argument
D) reducer updates the state
